Mar 2020,50,Week end in Livigno,"Amazing hotel, amazing staff, from the Receptionist till floor waitres.Was one wonderfull Experience, we felt at home, Room was beatifull and big with an amazing view, clean and silent, all staff was smiling.The SPA was special, swim in pool near to the snow Is an incredible Experience.I want to thank Mr Mauro, Ms Fogu, Mr Armando and his collaborator. And all the staff.Massimo Zolo"
Feb 2020,50,Once in a life time experience,"A fantastic weekend spent in an igloo. A unique and personalised experience. The staff were attentive and friendly. The only suggestion to other couples would be to ask for a private dinner instead of being put with another couple . Other than that, just brilliant and unforgettable."
Jan 2020,50,"Excellently manged friendly, clean relax-hotel with superb service!!","Relax-hotel directly situated at the ski-slopes. Offers very clean, spacious rooms, extremely attentive and friendly professional personell, first class suisine, The stay here (4 nights) was an excellent experience in every respect and we already enjoy to be guests in this Hotel again!! We can give a wholehearted recommendation without any restriction! Come and see yourselves."
Jan 2020,50,Generous hospitality ,"Even before we arrived we felt welcome at Hotel Lac Salin. We called ahead to organise a few things and everything is made easy by the helpful and welcoming staff at this ski in/ski out resort. Our rooms were gorgeous and an upgrade to a suite was very much appreciated. The spa and wellness centre is new and the attention to detail is incredible. Staff are at the ready to assist and the hotel policy appears to be based on generosity. The breakfast buffet and half board dinners were of a very high standard. The dinner was called a buffet but the entree and mains were ordered from a menu with a choice of three. The appetisers and dessert were via the buffet. Room service attention in the evening ensured that we had plenty of towels for the pool, salt pool and saunas. It was very hard to leave this fabulous hotel. Can’t speak highly enough of this experience."
Jan 2020,50,Super easy ski holiday hotel destination!,"The Hotel Lac Salin is well positioned in Livigno and can’t be beaten in terms of ease of stay. True ski in and ski out. First lift and lift pass office couldnt be more than 30 mars away. Ski hire located in the base of the boot room (all within the hotel) and ski in/out access from there. Our stay included half board, so breakfast and dinner. Quality of the food was great and I particularly liked the abundant salad bar and other assorted antipasto  to begin each evening meal with. Breakfast too was bountiful with eggs made to order available, as well as espresso coffee. The wait staff were amazing. So accommodating and they even came to the rescue of my daughter who nearly fainted one morning at breakfast. They also provided a lovely cake and happy birthday singing for my son. My only comment would seemed a little strange and disappointing to be charged for water (only at dinner) when everything else except alcohol was included at other times. In fact at breakfast there was even champagne available as part of the buffet. The rooms are well appointed and comfortable, although I did find the mattresses rather firm. The use of extra facilities such as the pool, gym, sauna and steam baths which are included in your stay are amazing and the couple of massages we had in the spa (paid for) also hit the spot!I feel a little guilty that I didn’t see too much of Livigno town itself because everything we needed was taken care of in the hotel! Management was lovely as were the ladies cleaning our rooms. All in all, a great stay and one Id highly recommend."
Jan 2020,50,Fantastic time in Livigno,"It’s our final day at the Lac Salin hotel but we have had a fantastic time here. The hotel is absolutely stunning. It’s situated right next to the piste and lifts, so getting out skiing everyday is very easy. The rooms were large with very comfortable beds and a great balcony to enjoy a drink on later in the day. The staff at the hotel were so welcoming and could not do enough to help you out. Finally the best thing about the hotel was the food! We had planned to eat out more but in the end we never wanted to miss out on the four course dinners each day!This is a great hotel to stay in if you are considering coming to beautiful Livigno."
Jan 2020,50,Loved the Snow Dream Experience!!!,"A staff member Rosita showed us the hotel and was extremely helpful, accommodating and knowledgeable! We ended up staying here in the snow chalet for the snow dream experience. It was such a breath taking place to stay. The thermal sleeping sleeping bags they gave us and the heating bags kept us toasty warm all night! They even brought us wine and tea before we hopped into bed and again brought us tea in the morning before taking us into our private breakfast area. We had access to the spa bathrooms all night as well so when we needed to use them we could easily go inside. In the morning after breakfast we had amazing spa and massage treatments. I absolutely love this place and think everyone should try the snow dream experience!!!!!"
Dec 2019,50,Such a beautiful place!,"It was our 3rd time staying at the Lac Salin in Livigno and it gets better every time.Livigno itself is wonderful and the Lac Salin is the perfect place to stay.The welcome, as before, was warm and friendly and it really feels like each member of staff is pleased that you are there.The food and the service from in the restaurant was fantastic and the dinner on Christmas Eve was special!The bar staff were also great and took pride in serving you, whether it be a pasta dish for lunch or a Moscow Mule in the evening.The location was perfect with the ski school on the doorstep and only a short walk into the centre of town.If I have one suggestion for improvement it would be the showers in the rooms. The shower heads are tiny and very difficult to control, which can lead to water going everywhere. Only a small point and did not affect our stay.One of the best parts of this trip was using the expanded Spa area. This was wonderful! From the new salt water jacuzzi pool to the fantastic swinging beds. It is luxurious and we loved it!In summary, this is a superb hotel with a lovely welcome in an ideal location with great staff! I did not want to leave and will certainly return!"
Dec 2019,50,The best hotel I've stayed in,"The hotel is pretty big, not what I usually enjoy on a snowboarding vacation, but I have to say everything was to my liking.The location is ideal. You are about 10 minutes on foot till Carosello 3000 gondola - or you simply use the T-bar lift 18 (Doss) from right above the hotel and then you can get to the gondola on the slope. Ski-out and ski-in are a big plus.The buses stop almost in front of the hotel, there's supermarkets, various shops and even restaurants/bars in the vicinity (if you want some variation).The rooms are spatious, warm, modern and newly-furbished. Bed offers excellent sleep quality.The wellness area is fabulous - with various places where one can unwind after a day on the slopes. Of course, the hotel offers everything to make this experience enjoyable.The food is excellent and the service is extremely fast, friendly and efficient. You always expect good food in Italy, but here it was varied, very tasty, in abundance and served fast and with a smile on the face.Check-in/out were efficient and the reception staff was helpful.The small goodbye gift was a nice touch.The sole small minus was the bad quality of the wi-fi connection (it was fast, but was consistently inconsistent). But in today's world, everybody has many Gbs of roaming traffic, so it's a non-issue.Will definitely come back."
Dec 2019,50,Perfect  stay,"very  good  quality  of  service,  great  location  regarding the  slopes  ,  fantastic food, room with  a  lot of  space and a  great  view of the mountains,  life music  at  the  bar in  the  evening, very  nice  and  helpful staff"
Sep 2019,50,A fabulous find with luxurious Spa,"I knew I was staying in a small town in the Alps. But what I didn’t know was how the hotel not only had such spacious, relaxing and comfortable rooms with views of the mountains they also had the most beautiful SPA area I have ever seen or used and I’ve seen a lot of them.  Let’s start with the staff.  The desk clerk Jurgita went completely out of her way to make our stay one of the best on our tour of the Alps and Dolomites.  She spent time going over maps with us of the town, the area, and even plotted our trip to Milan as some roads had been closed.  We loved the restaurant she sent us to.   It was quaint and the food was fantastic.  The hotel was very clean.  It is quite modern but had that ski lodge feeling."
May 2019,50,Amazing hotel for Family and Adults !,"I never write reviews. But I have to for this one.This is amazing hotel. The best parts are: --Location  20 meters to ski lift. You can literally ski into ski room. You do not have to carry any of   your skis around. That makes massive difference if you have kids and you have to   help them with skis and boots. There is also a ski rental in hotel if you want.    I could wake up at 08:00 take the lift nr 18. , ski to Gondola, go all the way to top  and ski back in around 30-40 minutes. That is amazing.  It is also very close to shops, restaurants, church and bus stop.  Also Trauma Clinic is 100m away if you need it. (We did need it :-(  )--Staff  People that work in Lac Salin make you feel like you are part of one big family.  The Director took us for snow walking trip with wine and cheese (thank you Mauro).   He was very helpful when my wife broke her leg. He even offered some free SPA to keep her busy!--Food  Every day 5 star meal in the evening with full waiter service. I would highly   recommend half board !!--Spa and swimming pool.    There are 3 different saunas. And good size swimming pool.Most of the guest I have spoken to in the hotel have been coming back for years. Some of them 7, 10 or even 12 years!Enjoy!"
Apr 2019,40,Perfect hotel for ski,"I spent a 10 day stay in this superb hotel on the slopes.  Telesales and ski school are located next to the hotel.  Pretty large room, modernly furnished and comfortable.  From the balcony you can see the mountains and the ski slopes.  The hotel is located 10-12 minutes walk from the center.  The bus station is located 100 m from the hotel. Breakfast and dinner are of excellent quality.  good coffee.  the services are impeccable.  Spa area and swimming pool are at the highest standards.  The bar is a nicely decorated and have a goog area for smokers.This hotel deserves the note 10. I will come back with great pleasure."
Apr 2019,50,"Excellent, hidden gem","Stayed for four days for spring skiing. First time in the area and will be back both to the area and to the hotel. Superb place. Friendly staff, perfect location and excellent rooms: clean, well laid out. Great village and restaurants nearby if you want a break from hotel meals."
Mar 2019,50,Best hotel in Livigno,"This 4-star hotel has done almost everything right. Ski rental in the same building, a short walk to the ski lifts, friendly English speaking staff, great food, comfortable rooms, good cleaning. Don’t miss ordering a Martini in the bar.The only downside I can think of is that the hotel does not have a shuttle service to the slopes on the other side and that the hotel WiFi is somewhat slow."
Feb 2019,50,Perfect location for out ski holiday,"Myself and my husband stayed in the Lac Salin for our weeks ski holiday in January.  What can I say?  It was wonderful.After a long transfer, being met by very efficient reception staff and offered a welcome drink on arrival was a lovely start to our stay there.Due to booking through a tour company we were expecting our room to be of an adequate standard, it well exceeded our expectations.  The room was very spacious with fantastic views down the valley from a spacious balcony, which we didn't get to use because it was so cold.  The room was very clean with every thing you needed for your stay, tea and coffee refilled daily and a mini bar if you should so wish to use it.What can I say about the staff except they were all wonderful.  The waiters and waitresses in the restaurant were very efficient and polite.  The bar staff were great in particular Elia, he was very welcoming and very informative in particular about the gins.  The food in the hotel could not be faulted, it was fresh and very tasty.  The bar also had a very extensive cocktail menu.This hotel is definitely the best hotel we have ever stayed in on a skiing holiday and we would not hesitate to go back there.Exceptional sums the place up."
Jan 2019,50,great hotel ski in ski out,"thanks a lot for a wonderful stay at your hotel. hotel provides end to end one stop shop ski experience.very friendly & helpfull staff. wonderfull spa with many treatments. our car diesel froze in our last day and the manager came to our help immediately, called a tow truck and helped us resolved the problem immediately and even drove us to the garage for free. could not ask for a better experience...thanks a lot lac salin! will sure come back and recommend!!!"
Dec 2018,50,Perfect ski hotel !!! ,"This is perhaps the best hotel in Livigno, exceeded all our expectations, excellent position, ski out in the hotel, clean and comfortable rooms, very friendly staff, excellent food and diverse, spa and wellness perfect, I would especially like to thank the owner of the Fabia Hotel and manager Maura, this is definitely our choice and the next time we reach Livigno, thank you for having existed."
Aug 2018,50,Just loved it,"I might just have been lucky, but what a room, it had anything i could’ve wanted. It was a very pleasant stay. Kind and friendly staff that provided a great service. Fantastic location with view to the mountains and downtown Livigno. Great hotel restaurant."
Aug 2018,50,Spectacular,"We spent a fantastic week here, for skiing and relaxation. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff. The rooms are first rate and the ambiance is simply perfect. I have had 10 skiing holidays in Livigno, in a variety of hotels and first came to Lac Salin about 4 years back, nothing comes close, for all round perfection. Although the hotel is fairly new, it has lots of character. If you enjoy quality look no further. The leisure facilities are equally top class and to top it all off, we (me and the delightful Mrs) had a fantastic morning snowshoeing with the hotel guide, Fabio. We cannot wait to go back again."
Aug 2018,50,Outstanding!,"The hotel was booked via cycle tours. We stayed 3 nights, cycled to Sondrio and stayed again 3 nights. Nicola gave us excellent sugestions for race bike trips. Stelvio, Mortirolo....The hotel staff welcomed us warmly. The room with balcony was clean, spacious with a bathroom with bath and shower. The dinners were worth a Michellin star as for the breakfast! The waiters and waitresses were friendly, polite and serving. And there was more....a spa with swimming pool, sauna etc.etc. All clean, tastefully furnished. Our bicycles were safely locked. We enjoyed a perfect stay at Hotel Lac Salin. A place to return to."
Aug 2018,50,Great base for summer mountain hiking/biking in Livigno,"Great place, superb restaurant, large spa area with pool, saline bath, bubble baths,... Staff is very helpful and greatly contributes to make your stay an enjoyable one. Breakfast buffet as a choice for everybody, evening restaurant (we warmly recommend staying half-board) is offering an every day chaging menu of great italian food. Big garage where you can clean an store your bikes. Nothing to change, we will be back!"
Jul 2018,40,too expensive for the quality,you need bus to go skiing. It is too expensive and not such good for the money. Rooms are good and big and spa is good also except it is too fancy. I would prefer good italian food not such fancy  as at theese restorant
May 2018,50,Unsurpassed levels of hospitality,"Have never experienced the level of service, communication and warmth as we experienced at this hotel. The rooms are crisp and clean as often found in mountain resorts and there are two restaurants to choose from when dining here. Very light too although personally I found the mattress too hard. Next time I would ask for a top layer which would help.We were with a large group for the Ghiacciodromo (also amazing!) and with another party who also gave this hotel 7 stars! The food was prepared especially for the group dinners and I found the level to be better than when dining privately but there are plenty of food dining options in this charming Ski town resort.There is also a car park below the hotel and they have a Spa which we did not have the opportunity to try as we were away all day. When we next visit the ice track (about 20 minutes drive) we will definitely consider staying here.The hotel is very well situated for the town."
Mar 2018,50,Ski holiday 2018,"This was our seventh year at Lac Salin and it was as wonderful as ever!  The rooms, facilities (particularly the first class spa area) and food are excellent, but it is the friendly staff at this family run hotel that make the experience special.  We hope to return for many years to come!"
Mar 2018,50,Winter Ski,"Perfect hotel, perfect staff, perfect location for the ski. Simply PERFECT :) Room was cleaned 2x per day, location exelent, breakfast perfect and if you wanna go shopping you can take free bus or taxi just for 10,- Eur for a drive..."
Mar 2018,50,"Outstanding place that absolutely exceeds your expectations, hotel, where anything is possible","If you are looking for the best accommodation and stunning traveler experience, you should definitively stay in hotel Lac Salin. Either you are coming during winter or summertime, here in the heart of Livigno valley, you will find all you need. Enjoy the sun while drinking your coffee on the hotel terrace, situated directly on the slope which changes to bikers and tourist paths in summer. Relax in the spacious and cosy spa, where you can choose from salty massage pool, herbal bath, saunas and much more. Grab a tea and immerse yourself in the calming atmosphere in relaxing zone. Try the selection of delicious local as well as international culinary dish. The staff is always happy to recommend you the best wine that fits with your meal. Finish your dinner with fine desserts and don't forget to visit the bar, where you can listen to live music. If you are looking for extraordinary experience, join the hotel activities, such as yoga, fat, and e-bikes or explore the cross-country tracks. However, the place wouldn't be so special without the ''vibe'' it has. The effort, friendly and individual approach, that each employee treats you with. Even though there is anything to complain about, if you have any personal difficulties, there is always someone to immediately help you. We have visited hotel Lac Salin more than 10 times and we have to say, that there are improvements in services as well as in facilities every year. Improvements that leads to perfection. Iva, Blanka, Mirek"
Mar 2018,50,"perfect location, great service","We found the hotel just by the chance on internet and we were happy! Livigno is very long and that hotel has a super location as to the shopping, just walking distance, and for skiing. Just behind hotel there is a lift from which you can reach a new cabin-lift and go for all slopes. ANd back from skiing you wil just enter the door of ski room.Perfekt food, nice bar and very friendly and helpfull staff, especialy Giuseppe at the bar - if you need any advice or help, ask him! The whole area is perfeft for kids, nice slopes, wide, amazing."
Mar 2018,50,great location and great staff,"Excellent location , large and comfortable rooms  . Good breakfast and dinner , excellent wine list . Relaxing pool and SPA . All the staff make you feel at home . Overall an excellent stay . Will definitely be back next year"
Feb 2018,50,"Great service, great food and wine list (very fair prices)",Nicely located ski in / ski out. Not in the center of the city but 7 minutes away by taxi. Great service and our half board was perfect - good variation and very fair wine prices with an excellent wine list catering for all ...
Feb 2018,50,Lovely Stay,"I loved my stay at Lac Salin. The rooms were clean, spacious, very comfortable, and the amenities everything I could require. Great food in the hotel restaurant too. The spa in particular was lovely, especially the hydro pools. What really stood out for me was the service - very personal touch, friendly and accommodating, and that is what made it the perfect stay for me. The staff and management really made a huge effort to do what they could for guests. I would definitely stay here again!"
Jan 2018,50,Very nice hotel,"As a frequent traveller around the world I can only say that this hotel and the restaurant inside are really nice. Rooms are big, soundproof and the staff is dedicated. Regarding the restaurant, we booked half board for the 4 days and we had dinner like in a big restaurant. All the dinners were tasty and we choose some good wines at affordable prices. One thing to be ameliorated could be noise in the restaurant, but apart from this I can only recommend"
Jan 2018,50,Excellent location and service,Great location with direct access to the skiing area. The room was excellent with a great view to the mountains and the city. The personal was friendly and very service minded. Ski hire in the hotel was great
Jan 2018,50,"Great stay, great food, Great area for both skiing and in the summer time","Great hotel with great food, wellness area - and a fantastic weather for skiing. Also great in the summertime - the area offers so many possibilities.Nice service and a great atmosfare. However - the only thing is, that we where missing the former guide - Filippo !"
Jan 2018,20,Awful New Year dinner and food,"1. Rooms are clean.2. Location of the hotel is good.3. Speed of check-in and check-our was unacceptably low. Also the receptionist by mistake gave our passports to the other family that travelled with us. This was discovered only after my inquiry on a he passport issue. This is absolutely unacceptable. 4. New Year dinner was a complete disaster. We went to sleep absolutely hungry. Also we needed to order French fries and chicken for kids in addition to the New Year menu to feed them. As the result, the mood was spoiled. We regretted a lot, that our two families had to spend the New Year evening in Lac Salin.5. In general the quality of food in your hotel is bad. Surprisingly for Italy neither variety nor taste was good. Only one of every 3 dishes tasted good.6. The spa and water area is good. We enjoyed several visits there. What we didn’t like is that when we used the second lift in the rear of the hotel to come from the room to spa and back it was really cold there. Unacceptably cold as for people who are traveling with wet hair back to their rooms. Massage treatments were good.When we gave the hotel review, instead of apologizing and taking steps to improve the quality of service in the future, the hotel manager wrote that he disagrees with everything and blamed our kids for “spoiling the mood of other guests, as they were running around the restaurant”.To sum up: good location, bad food, spoiled New Year, narrow-minded, lazy and completely unprofessional management.If you stay there for skiing, do not buy their half board, as there are tens of good restaurants just around the corner."
Dec 2017,50,Exceptional!,"We spent the last week at the wonderful Hotel Lac Salin.We are beginner skiers and could not have chosen a better location. You can rent ski’s/ski equipment from the hotel. The ski school and baby slopes are 20m away. The hotel is clean, comfortable and the service incredible (the owner even carried our bags to the bus when we left!)The food was delicious with many options for vegetarians.The new spa opened whilst we were at the hotel. It has wonderful facilities (sauna, steam room, salt bath, jacuzzi, pool) that are perfect to ease your sore body after a day on the slopes.Our room was well equipped with a very comfortable bed and great linen and had stunning views of the slopes.We cannot wait to return!"
Dec 2017,50,Excellent service,"We stayed with our little family for the past five days. All the Lac Salin crew are very service-minded, helpful and caring for your pleasant holiday! Great breakfast and diners. We certainly come back!"
May 2017,40,Classic ski hotel .,"Rooms are huge , modern and comfortable and spa is with standard options .In the short it it classic ski hotel in mountain , which when you selected you will be not disappointed but also not surprised ."
Apr 2017,30,Safe choice but expensive during high season,"Rooms are spacious enough for 2 persons. Bed comfort is ok, but no pillow choice.Small tv, and very slow internet is a let down for a hotel of this standard. Streaming is nearly impossible.Bathroom : bath with shower and double sink. Toilet in bathroom. Between bathroom and bedroom is a glass wall... so  putting on the light at night wakes up the room. Bit strange...Spa is complete, swimming pool is noisy.Compact fitness.Restaurant : great breakfast, salad bar and dessertbar. The main courses are a lacking taste.Sun terras next to bar.Good ski cellar with service center.Staff and management is very friendly and helpfull : 10/10.Connection to carosello 3000 next to hotel, busses stop almost in Front of hotel.Prices are premium during season... which makes me quoting this as average."
Mar 2017,40,Great location!,Ski in and Ski out! (To the children's area)Good lunch.Great place for a coffee when you're kids are at ski school.To far from the city center for my taste.But a perfect spot if you have small children.
Mar 2017,50,TUTTO BENE!,"Location, location, location + big room with the super view, delicious food, amazing staff and great ski rental. Extremely helpful and sufficient reception (special thanks to Christina). Comfortable underground parking with self service car wash. The best ski hotel ever. It was our 3rd time in Lacsallin and plan to come back every winter."
Mar 2017,50,Very friendly staff and awesome hotel altogether,"I had a chance to visit this hotel twice within one month and both times I was impressed by the staff. Everyone is greeting you with a wide smile everywhere you go and it doesn't look that they are pushing it. They just look generally excited and feel that they care especially the manager himself. And I believe that's they key here as the manager has employed like-minded people. For example, I had to arrive at 8 PM but was running late and they called me to ask if everything is OK(you can check-in 24/7 and that's not an issue, they were just worried that I might get lost or something), if I need any guidance etc. I missed the dinner the day I arrived but they prepared some cold dish and left in my room. This is just one example but there were many occasions when staff goes above and beyond to help you. The hotel is children friendly but it comes with noise. So if you want to enjoy silence in pool, dinner, hallways or anywhere else this hotel might not be for you. I generally like this kind of noise since it makes everything more alive. Food is great, even a special menu for vegetarians (I am not one but it is good to know) which is something you don't see too often. SPA area is well maintained and it has everything you might want. One major drawback is Wi-Fi which is very, very unstable. First time I stayed I had a room on the side where I had a good cellular connection (prepaid TIM data card), so I used that instead but during the 2nd stay, cellular wasn't an option in my room which was a bit upsetting. Really hope that they can work out Wi-Fi problems but other than that I highly recommend this hotel to everyone."
Feb 2017,50,Great Hotel with superior service,"We stayed here for a week for ski vacation in February. Hotel is great, service is fantastic and the spa is beautiful. Rooms are modern and light and the staff is so helpful. The food is good, we had some great meals and some that was more average, but there are plenty of options for dinner.Extra thank you for the help we got when our son got sick during our stay, that's the kind of service that makes the difference between a good and a great hotel 👍"
Jan 2017,50,"6 stars, seriously!","We travel quite a lot both for business and pleasure, but have never ever, anywhere in the world come across a hotel experience like this one.The rooms are large, modern, up to date. The hotel offers a parking garage on premise at no additional cost.We had two different rooms (as we decided to extend our stay, and both had great views of the mountain and of Livigno.The hotel has ski in/ski out and a ski renting and service center as well.Admission to the spa (14 years minimum age) is included in the price and it is great (Steam bath, Finnish sauna, and herbal/aroma sauna), plus a decently sized pool with various massage jets and a jacuzzi where kids are allowed till 16:00.Housekeeping was great and included turndown-service at night.We had half-board, consisting of a generous buffet of starters followed by two main courses and a dessert buffet that varied every night. Breakfast too had everything you could wish for, in great quality (including an ""omelet""-station, juicer, etc. etc.). The hotel also has an other restaurant where we dined one night which was a super-cosy alpine-style ""stube"" and where the food was as good or better as in the half-board, and the servings were enormous. Both restaurants also had an excellent wine list So... all in all, it's a great hotel in a beautiful localtion, that in itself would make me rank it ""5 stars"" (despite their own rating of ****S), so why the title ""6 stars..."" on this review?Because of the people. Oh my God. Even in 5 star hotels in Asia we have never experienced such amazing service. EXCEPTIONALLY courteous and acutely attentive. When my wife needed medicine, the reception offered to go to he pharmacy for her!From day to day, they remembered your preferences and brought you what you needed before you'd even asked for it.I could go on and on, but I think you get my point :-)Although all staff was great, some stood out and deserves special applause: Dimitrios (greatest waiter we ever had), Andrea (second greatest ;-), Alessandro (restaurant manager(?) who was fast and everywhere and nothing escaped his attention), Daniele, Pasquale, everyone on the reception, and finally Mr. Bortolotti (hotel manager) whose personal attention, active participation everywhere and friendliness was second to none.I urge anybody visiting Livigno to do themselves a favor and stay at the Lac Salin.We will, when we return to this area!"
Jan 2017,50,New Year Celebration,"We stayed at Lac Salin for 3 nights, a family of 4 including two young children, and were lucky to celebrate the new year at this special place. Livigno is a beautiful town with great restaurants, friendly peope and every possible sport for every season.Lac Salin...This is not a 4 star hotel, it's a 10 star hotel. This is a true boutique hotel. Modern and convenient yet full of character and local ambience. Every detail is thought of and made to perfection. The staff is extremely professional, friendly, hard working and going out of their way to help in any possible way. No request is too much. Especially Daniele and the entire team at the restaurant with whom we spent three magical evenings. The new year GALA was really special.  The food is outstanding, beautiful, tasty and generous. The views of the snowy mountains from our balcony were great. and the fireworks at the snow. The Ski room, ski rental, SPA, everything is perfectly arranged and equiped according to the highest standards. Kids are very welcome. We felt at home. Will definitely come back. 3 days is not enough."
Dec 2016,50,1st family Xmas away - Prestige Room - ,"This was our first Xmas holiday so thought we'd try skiing and were beginners apart from my husband! It was amazing this hotel is directly on the slope for beginners and has easy access to the other slopes where you can catch the gondola or chair lift for many more challenges. We were travelling with Neilsen so helped us arrange lessons and equip hire etc so everything was on our doorstep! Ski Teachers were very patient and really good. The hotel and staff were amazing everything is perfect and they can't do enough for you. Definitely worth their 4+ stars. Felt very special to be a part of their extended family for this week and we will return! The prestige room was lovely and had enough room for the four of us. Our girls are 7 & 12. Bear in mind there are only around 5 English channels on the tv with no DVD player or sky box (as shown in pics) these English channels are all news! So bring already downloaded films with you if you like a bit of quiet time in your room for half hour before dinner! As dinner is at 7pm which is quite late for us anyway!! 6pm would have been much better and made quite a difference to us. The Xmas eve gala dinner was fabulous, but was also very late as food didn't get out until about 8.45pm by which point we were all ready for bed, the kids were already too tired and very hungry...the menu was also a bit adventurous for the children so they didn't eat much and went away still a bit hungry! It probs would have been better to have fruit salad for starters for them and then simple pasta and roast chicken dishes thereafter just for kids otherwise it seems a bit of a waste of all that beautiful food! Santa also visited the children on Xmas eve and handed them their presents (previously sneakily handed in to reception) which was very magical.  However it would have been nice for other parents to stick to normal parent Santa rules of one present per child and also presents for children only (it's very confusing when other kids are getting way more than one and also adults are getting four or five too, which is a waste of time and then the questions of why did their own parents not get anything from Santa starts happening and gets tricky to explain!) it would be helpful if reception could stipulate this in future for everybody's sanity! However these minor blips did not spoil our time as we will definitely return again. We flew to Innsbruck and had a nearly 3 hour transfer each way which was pretty seamless each way. We were lucky with the weather and the snow cannons were creating snow every night and lorries / machines continually working to ensure there was enough extra snow to ski on, which did not disappoint as there was more than enough. Shopping in livigno town was very good and moncler outlet was brilliant all staff were very helpful and spoke English! You have to try a bombardino if you visit too! Spa facilities were fabulous, only steam room missing is a salt room and my life would have been complete lol! But you can't have it all aye! Swimming pool was also lovely and always quiet even when my girls were in there. :-). Can't recommend this place enough! We were also lucky enough to be there while they were filming and taking photos and were given usb's to take home for us to watch at our leisure which tells the lac salin story beautifully including all of the extra activities the hotel put on over Xmas. We were half board so breakfast and dinner were included every day. Apart from any drinks at dinner. There are a few local supermarkets a couple of mins walk away for water and snacks etc. The town is about a 20-30 min walk but the buses are always free to use and frequent so was never a problem actually preferred being a bit away from the town as less busy. The hotel had built an ice bar and snow lounge outside which was really cool too!"
Oct 2016,50,Amazing customer service,"If only all hotels had customer service like this. The hotel staff went out of their way to make our stay as comfortable and relaxing as possible. The food was incredible, the views of the valley is stunning and the location in this small town is fairly easy to reach most places. Stay here, you cannot go wrong."
Oct 2016,50,Very relaxing weekend in a nice atmosphere ,"We did visit the hotel for a long weekend. The staff is very friendly and helpful, the room was clean and well equipped. The hotel offers also a charging infrastructure for a Tesla which is quite nice.The breakfast is very good with a large selection on local food. We did also had dinner in the hotel which is good with a large wine selection for a very decent price. The hotel is a bit outside the main area but within 5-10 minutes walk this is not an issue.We will certainly return next time we are in Livigno."
Sep 2016,40,Thomas O'Leary,"4th returning. Absolutely brilliant customer service from arrival to departure. Excellent food, weather and amazing walks and activities. Food was world class.... as usual. Put Livigno on your bucket list and ""just go there"" you will NOT regret it!"
Sep 2016,50,Livigno 2016,"Lac Salin always very very good. You can't go wrong in a special Hotel like this. From there you can easily reach the top of the mountains and the city centre as well.  (full of good shops). The Staff always ready to help you for every kind of need, very professional and very polite. The SPA well organised , this year I met a SRI  LANKA masseur very good and skillful. Restaurants with good local food, but you can also have fish. Wine cellar at the Top. The right place to send your best friends. MaxBugatti."
Aug 2016,50,Mountain spa,"The Mandira Spa is a spacial yet intimate place entirely confined within the hotel grounds, well equipped and designed to offer an ultimate relaxation. You can choose between sauna or steam bath, whirlpool or jacuzzi, and lots of holistic treatments like oriental massages and regenerative practices that you can enjoy on your own or with your partner."
Jul 2016,40,Great base for mountain bike trips,"We have been to Lac Salin several times, first time more than 10 years ago, still a nice place with great service and good spa, but this last time we noticed that it might need a renovation soon to keep up with the trend. The spa is well run also with beauty services on a very good level."
Jul 2016,50,Cartrip,"Very nice place with exellent food and service. Looking forward to our next visit. Such a nice mountaintown to walk around in, before getting back to this beautiful hotel. Everything as expepted. 1class charging facilities for Tesla as well."
Apr 2016,40,A High Quality Hotel in a Great Location,"We booked this hotel as part of a NEILSON skiing holiday. It is in a fantastic location right at the side of the nursery slopes and 50 m from where the kids ski schools meet in the morning. Our room was of a high standard with quality fixtures and fittings, our own bathrobes and slippers ( even a smaller one for our 8 year old which he was delighted about). We had a view of the town and the Mottolino ski area from our balcony. My only concern was that it was sold to us by NEILSON as a deluxe family room which had a separate living room area for the 17 and 8 yr old on sofa beds ( as shown even now on the website). Unfortunately when we got there we found that the room we believed we had booked was classed as a premier room which hadn't been an option on Neilson and we were in a much smaller room so we were crammed into a basic sized  room with a sofa bed, not very comfortable for a week and definitely not enough cupboard space for all of our kit. Despite this the high standards of our hotel allowed us to relax quickly especially with a glass of wine on the terrace watching the beginners and children. The food in the restaurant was of a very high standard so much so that for a couple of nights we ate in town so that the kids could ir preferred food! Our waitress, Erica was lovely and couldn't do enough for us. The spa was very good and the sports massage I had to have after a few days hard skiing was just the job. The bar was not very busy but very comfortable. The staff were excellent especially Allesso and Marco. The entertainment wasn't brilliant but as their were not many in it didn't really matter. the skiing was excellent though we were lucky with the weather, there are two ski areas, the Mottolino area and the Carosello which was at the back of the hotel but are mainly reds with a few blacks but they are easy reds compared to French ones! The food and drink were very decently priced for mountain restaurants as was the town itself which was tax free. It was a long transfer to the resort from Innsbruck but well worth it."
Mar 2016,40,Best Hotel in Town,"Everything in one place. Ski lifts at your door. Friendly staff, great rooms, cool apres ski on the patio. Highly recomend this charming hotel, not too small not too big. Easy walk into the village.must go."
Mar 2016,50,Excellent Hotel,Hotel Is located Via saroch near to carosello.very luxury hotel.rooms are very beautiful.Livigno is very famouse for sking at the winter season.summer very good for mountain climbing.january so cold to me.but resturants/room facilities/Cleaning are at very high standerd.i love livigno also hotel lac salin
Mar 2016,30,Something changed......,We have been coming to this resort for 4 year but over the last two years the quality has gone down especially in relation the food served. It is like something is missing the the something that gave it the hotel the 4+ . Overall the service is High and the rooms are great.Hope that the food Will change to the better again
Feb 2016,50,Counting down the days,"We are counting down the days....Within a few week it will be our seventh visit to this very nice hotel, which our kids almost see as their second home. Lac Salin has an excellent location at the end of the village but right on the slopes. The rooms are large and well-equipped. The ski hire in the hotel is convenient and gives an excellent service. Friendly service and kind staff. The manager is always making sure everything is running smoothly. Great bar and restaurant with friendly and attentive customer service especially from manager Ignazio, waiter Danieli and bartender Alessio."
Feb 2016,40,Nice Hotel in beautiful Livigno,"This hotel is very nice and cosy. The service and the hospitality of the staff is impecular. It is located in the upper part of livigno so you can walk down the main road and do all the shops, bars and restaurants. Their spa and the massages are very good as well"
Feb 2016,50,Excellent hotel in good ski resort,"Loved this hotel. The staff are excellent. Lovely welcome on arrival, early check in to accommodate our wish for half day skiing.  Restaurant staff as mentioned all lovely, helpful & attentive. Also housekeeping; came around in the evening to change towels & turn down beds as well as during the morning. Spa pool is very much that not a swimming pool which is why I guess they discourage young children. Always lovely quiet place with great atmosphere to relax in after your swim. Food: so much choice morning & evening & all really tasty - hats off to the chef! If I were to mention any negatives, & they really are v small, bath towels could do with being bigger (& a bit fluffier!) & the bar in the evening could have been designed to be warmer & more welcoming.  We found it chilly & not very well used.  But those are minor observations, I will definitely be coming back to the hotel.  Livingo suffered from a lack of snow, mainly off piste, but the snow was still good on piste even on the very warm days (8 degrees skiing in January?? Come on!) didn't turn to slush as in other resorts.  Good skiing on both mountains, easy to use the buses to get to & from the other side of the resort.Flew into Innsbruck, @ 2/3 hours from there. But worth the journey."
Jan 2016,50,Amazing service and first class ski gear rental,"We had a lovely stay, the staff were always helpful and very polite. We paid for half board and the breakfast and supper options were varied, interesting and definitely worth it. The included spa options (sauna, pool, steam room etc.) were a daily post ski indulgence. I would like to mention the ski gear rental especially. The man in charge was friendly, helpful and the costs (with on the spot discounts) were cheaper than any of the prebooked gear rentals I could find. I broke a ski pole which he replaced free of charge and he swapped out boots for those of us who needed it until we were all happy.What a great stay. A bit rough with the unexpected Rand/Euro exchange free fall but still worth it.The hotel allows 30 days pre booking date 100% refund so if you book and feel the price is currently fair, pay in full to avoid later disappointment. You can always cancel later."
Jan 2016,50,Beautiful Hotel with everything you could ask for.,"Large room with every ammenity possible,great views of the mountains and the village. The staff were friendly and always very helpful. The meals were sumptuous and generous with extraordinary spreads for both breakfast and evening meals.Ski hire was available within the hotel itself , making it easy and convenient"
Jan 2016,50,Excellent choice for a winter break,"Visited in January, two of us and an 8-year old kid. Modern, spacious room, with a small balcony overlooking the slopes. Large bathroom. A king-sized bed, and a sofa for the kid. Heaters are large to dry your clothes. TV -- smallish. The only minus about the room is that there is a glass door in the bathroom into the sleeping area and you can see through it (or if the light is on, it may bother you). No coffee machine or tea kettle.Very good breakfasts -- all the usual basic things you might want. A bottle of wine is available in the mornings for those craving.Dinners -- very good, service is attentive, wine list -- extensive. 2-3 menu options every day. There is also a gourmet restaurant -- excellent service and slightly better food for a 15+euro per person.Hotel staff go out of their way to please you, service is excellent.Wifi is free, but is slow.The swimming pool is large and has an adjacent jacuzzi. There are several saunas -- finnish, steam and herbal, showers and ice room. Only minus -- they don't allow kids younger than 14 (for unclear reasons) -- but if you are careful, you can sneak your kid in.The hotel has its own ski rental/storage and is located 50 meters away from the lifts to the slopes and a ski passes shop.It takes about 4 hours to get to the hotel by taxi from Milan (at 450 euros) or you can take a taxi to Tirano (1.5 hours and 110 euros) and then 2.5 hours by train to Milan.Livigno is a large village with lots of shops to walk about in the evenings. Lots of sports shops, there are several apre-ski bars in the central area. The central area is much livelier than the part where Lac Salin stands (but it takes 15 minutes walk to get to the center or about 5 min by taxi -- 10 euros on average)."
Dec 2015,50,Excellent,Best holiday of my life. Most excellent and friendly service. Family friendly. The heated pool after a hard day of skiing is perfect for the sore body. Thanks to the staff for making our holiday a pleasurable one. Thanks to Nicola for his patience on the slopes. He is the best instructor out there.
Sep 2015,50,Stuck in the snow on two wheels,"Was on my way to the stelvio pass on my motorbike after getting over the swiss Furka & Julier pass,  and the Bernina pass over to Italy, decided to stay in Livigno as the weather was bad, it got worst when I saw the snow in the morning, no go on two wheels, so extended my stay at the Lac Salin, after all Euro 94 incl diner & Breaky in a 4 stars hotel isn't a bad deal at all, the place breathes luxury, comfort & warmth with all amenities, lockup garage ect .... I recommend the top 3rd floor for quietness, the floor between 2nd & first, 3rd & second are of a wood type and you can hear people above if they are noisy or of the heavy steps type, I had a family with kids above me and had to ask to change to a higher room ......haven't tried the wellness & spa yet but will for sure, apart from that its faultless, service, amenities, food ect ..... they seem to be cheaper at the reception than on the web though .... just hoping for the snow to stop so I can get going on my two wheels again  ...."
Sep 2015,50,Anniversary ,"LAC SALIN Spa. Always OVER the Top. Kindness is the word to use for all the Staff,I really say for all the staff. Restaurants inside the Hotel very good. Very Clean Hotel. I am sure One of the BEST. From there you can reach easily the city centre and by cable car you can go ( must go) to Carosello 3000 near the beautiful Lac Salin little lake up there. Do not miss this experience. max."
Aug 2015,50,passion to please the guests !,"We were in Lac Salin for 8 days and from the beginning to the end the whole staff (in special Sergey in resto, Allessio in the bar and Mr Giacomelli in general) are always listening to their guests and if any small remark or question to try to solve very quickly !! But also the whole staff from welcome till the end is very helpfull.The room was very nice and spacious and clean. The restaurant serves various and very good food (special the antipasta buffet & dessert buffet). Extensive winelist at good prices. The hotel is situated at the end of the village, so you have a very nice view on the Forcola side. we recommend this hotel and we will for sure go back (it seems the ski area is nice !)"
Jul 2015,50,Livigno....not just a ski resort!!,"Just back from a memorable holiday in the Lac Salin Resort in Livigno. What a hotel!! The welcome, style, friendliness, ambiance was excellent. The restaurant and its food were out of this world. Wonderfully managed by Ignazio, his catering team produce meals of the highest quality and presentation. So Livigno for snow and sun and Lac Salin for all year round excellence."
May 2015,40,Ski holiday,"Excellent location 10 m to the lift for skiing just by the bar,food fantastic we were half board but with the restaurants in the area area so good and well priced we would do 1 week half board and eat out for the second skiing is great for all ages we had a instructor for our daughter he really kept her interested and focused for 2 weeks which takes some doing the central ski school in town the advantage of being 5 mins walk from town is you are in the old part great restaurants by you that if you stay in the main part you would never see for the very advanced probably not the best resort but for great big mountain skiing huge wide slopes even on half term not too busy until about 2 in the afternoon because the area is tax free staying here isn't crazy money like a lot of other resorts but the après is great have been on a lads week and family holiday and caters for both I would recommend the dog sledding it's crazy The hotel are very helpful great staff pool ans sauna are great plent of room the spa for massages etc is excellent even giving children 20 minute massage my daughter loved it as a treat would stay again"
Apr 2015,50,Italy in the mountains,What a wonderful surprise Positano in the mountains a rare place to relax with skiing things to to do especially shopping not least bike riding dog sledging tobogganing amazing views officially breathtaking stars
Mar 2015,50,Best hotel in Livigno,"Very nice overal expierence, but need little refubrishing in the rooms. Returning customer for 10yrs. Top quality restaurant and personal - Chief and Manager of the resaurant Ignasio. Perfect bar and Spa with amnities."
Feb 2015,50,Fantastic,"We spent 3 days here with Lamborghini ice driving experience. The staff and attention to detail where great, the manager talked us in on phone from lake Garda and given us advice on best way back to UK. The spa was good, the herb and steam were not working one day which was probably the only niggle. We didn't have time to experience the ski in facilities but it's just at end of slope. Would recommend and would live to come back the whole village is lovely"
Feb 2015,50,Winter magic,"We just recently spent 12 nights at the wonderful Lac Salin Spa and Resort in Livigno.  Everything from the wonderful, accommodating staff to the rooms, food, and facilities were superb.There is an in hotel ski hire office with very competitive rates and they also offer private and group ski lessons through their in house ski instructors.  We used both these services and it was very convenient and the instructor was a gem.There is a kiddies ski school right outside the hotel and they offer group and private lessons which are great for 1st timers (like us) or for the experienced skier.Although the hotel is about 2kms from central Livigno, its a very easy and pleasant walk to everything.The hotel also offers free wifi everywhere and there's an indoor heated pool, jacuzzi, gym, steam room and sauna available to all guests which was great to use everyday after spending the day outside on the snow.I wouldn't hesitate for a minute in recommending Lac Salin Resort to anyone and we will definitely be back for another winter holiday."
Jan 2015,50,Fantastico!,"We stayed at Lac Salin as a family with two teenage kids between Christmas and New Year.  The staff were professional and friendly. The ""in house"" ski rental and quick walk to a ski lift made for a pleasant skiing experience.  The restaurant food was of the highest quality with attentive staff.  The Spa was a treat with all the saunas, jacuzzi and relax rooms included.  We would highly recommend this hotel.  The hotel management were always present and eager to please.  We had a fantastic New Year's Eve Party with great entertainment."
Jan 2015,50,Wonderful,"Our stay at Lac Salin was over Christmas week as a couple for skiing. Though the snow was alittle disappointing the skiing was still fine up in the higher areas. Christmas meant the hotel was probably filled with more families than usual, but did not interfere with our stay at all and looked like an excellent place to bring the family with the ski school slopes directly outside the hotel. Special Santa visit on Christmas eve was very sweet...though I am happy not to hear another Christmas carol for at least another 300 odd days!Staying at Lac Salin meant there were many other wonderful things to do. Access to the extensive Spa area was free and available most of the time - interesting sauna rooms (turkish/steam/herbal) a small gym, good sized pool, spa etc etc.We had the cheapest room which was still extremely generous size, wonderful bath and very clean and comfortable and balcony over the slopes.Our stay included Breakfast and dinner which was served in the large dining room with buffet and menu choices and a wonderful wine list, each night's choices were different, the high quality food was interesting and delicious.Far and above the thing that made our stay so special and why we will return was the friendly, professional staff in all areas. Special mention to the friendly and helpful - Paulo, Vitaly, Blessing and Milos."
Dec 2014,50,Perfect summerstay in the mountains,"Very high quality hotel with perfect resturant and good relaxation. We stayed in a 2 floor familyroom with terrace facing the city, which is perfect with kids. Stayed there for a whole week which was NOT a bit to long - lot of fun activies for the whole family. We experienced 20 degrees and snow in that week. For skiiers and other mountain lovers this is a must experience hotel."
Oct 2014,40,Hotel Lac Salin old fashioned italian family hotel,"This hotel calls up very different emotions.Location is on the slopes of the piste of Livigno, great location, little bit outside the to busy city centre.Rooms are very good, nothing to complain, nice balcony, nice view on the slopes.Entrance is not very nice, there is not such a thing as a pleasant lobby! The restaurants are ok, very good service, very traditional set up of tables, reasonable Italian food. The decor you might call very attractive for Russian's, but for our taste, a little bit to much glitter.Apart from this a very nice indoor swimming-pool, with a very good spa, definitely a recommendation!Overall a very nice family hotel, good location and reasonable good food.Only one thing, Livigno ski area is divided in two pieces because of the valley. Unfortunately you can not ski from one side to the other, you have to make a choice every day where to ski!"
Sep 2014,50,"Very nice, modern hotel","Very modern hotel, excellent service, great buffet breakfast. We really enjoyed the swimming pool and the spa facilities in general. Upon arrival we received a welcome drink, which was very nice. I am sure we will go back to this hotel in the future."
Sep 2014,50,4 th Honeymoon with the same wife. (32) years.,"After many years, I always discover Lac Salin Hotel more& more beautiful and resourceful.Of course I am talking about aTop Hotel with restaurants inside  managed by mr. Ignazio very professional, besides, you'll find a wonderful SPA. Very Very good for relaxing mind& body. Very clean with a Staff always ready to Help you. All my good friends have already tried IT, and they are ALL happy.      max.Molto molto valido, da consigliare al tuo migliore AMICO."
Aug 2014,40,Best place in Livigno,We stayed here for a week in the summer time with two kids. The Hotel is very good with very nice facilities and a nice spa/pool area. Good and helpfull service. The 2 level family room is recommendable when you have kids. Food - both breakfast and dinner - is good italian standard. However wines at the wine list are of other vintage than they serves (and this is not mentioned). We are ready for another visit !
Apr 2014,50,Wonderful stay,"We stayed at the Lac Salin Spa and Mountain Resort for our honeymoon. The service was excellent, the rooms were modern and clean and the food at the restaurant was amazing! We chose the half board option which included a four course dinner and were very happy with our decision. There are slopes right next to the hotel where we could have our skiing lessons. The hotel also includes spa facilities which we really enjoyed after a morning of skiing. The staff were very professional and friendly, and went out of their way to make our stay more comfortable. We enjoyed every moment of our time at this wonderful hotel."
Apr 2014,40,Convenient alpine base,"We have stayed at Lac Salin off the main season, so the perspective is a little different. Most of the restaurants and attractions in Livigno were closed, so we were doomed to use the hotel facilities more intensive way. But it was gooood....The restaurant has great ambient (especially the wooden rustic area), the service is just excellent, food exquisite and wine matched properly to the dishes. This was absolutely excellent experience for both dinner and breakfast.Hotel itself is located outside of the Livigno city center, but close to trails leading to the tops of the mountains surrounding the valley. Rooms are compact, but good enough for two people and have nice views to the surroundings (no backyard nightmares). Very clean, but you can smell the chemicals used to keep up. I also would;t like to fit into the room with 2+2 family - it would be too crowdy.Free parking for hotel guests. Free WiFi. Ability to rent the mountain bikes on site.Helpful and smiling reception staff. They have even called us checking if we can find the way to the hotel.Certainly a good place to enjoy a romantic getaway or sporty extended weekend."
Mar 2014,50,Indulgement in Livigno,"Whenever you're going to Livigno and are in for a great time, for sure you have to go to Hotel Lac Salin. The rooms are furbished to perfection as is actually the whole hotel. Breakfast is great, as is diner. The wine-list is extensive with all Italian greats and some mondial as well.Finding a friendlier staff wil give you a hard time.The hotel is ideally located directly at the slopes enabling you to ski directly from your room.Once your muscles are overheated try the spa and swimming pool - they're great!Do yourself a favour and have a look at: www.lungolivigno.comMind you, I'm independent and not on their payroll but enjoyed such a good time that I simply have to share it with you."
Feb 2014,50,Overwhelming,"Excellent service by the entire staff, immaculate rooms, delicious and high quality food.Absolute TOP hotel. This hotel is a must for an absolute perfectly maintained holiday and can compete with the best available hotels in the area."
Feb 2014,50,Amazing,"We went to Livigno for my 50th birthday and my husband enlisted the directors' help to give me the most amazing birthday ever.  Dinner in one of the small dining rooms, flowers...( where they got them I don't know) a beautiful birthday cake and dancing in the bar later.  They really made me feel incredibly special.  The food is wonderful and the service very good.  The rooms are lovely.  We stayed there 3 years ago and spent a lot of time in the spa.  The only problem I found this time was a lot of screaming, undisciplined small children in the spa. The spa area should be for adults or at least no under 12 year olds.  Perhaps aslo seating all parents with small children in one area in the dining room is a good idea.  We will certainly be back."
Jan 2014,40,Fantastic,"Another great week at Lac Salin. Excellent friendly service from everyone from the hotel director to the restaurant waiters, nothing was too much trouble for them. Great food as can be expected from this kind of establishment. Fantastic location and excellent facilities. €10 extra charge for delivery of two teas to the room should be re-considered since there are no tea/coffee facilities in the rooms.Screaming undisciplined children in the dining room and the hotel's SPA our only complaint. Would like to see a little bit more control of kids from the hotel for the benefit of the other guests."
Dec 2013,50,best in Livigno,"Very recomended hotel with great stuff, very good location excellence half board and pet friendly. Garage for car is included. Spa is excelent, clean:-) wifi is free and speed is ok... we were each year in others 4stars hotels in Livigno, but this was best one. The dinner is too late and it was the only one weakness"
Oct 2013,50,Wonderful stay,"We stayed for 1 night in Feeling Room number 2, ""Luna""We were here in the very low season, however everything in the hotel seemed to be open for business.On arrival we were offered a welcome drink of Prosecco that we enjoyed in the comfortable chairs in the lobby while our checkin was processed. After that we were shown to the room. Checkin was efficient and friendly. We were supplied with a discount voucher to use in the restaurant as well as a shopping card that can be used in a variety of the duty free stores in the town.Each of the Feeling Rooms is decorated in a different style/theme. The Luna room was very stylish and modern with a huge ( extremely comfortable) leather bound, King size sleigh bed facing the windows, behind it was a full width wardrobe and behind that is the expansive bathroom area.The bed was the most comfortable one we slept in on our Italian trip, a true King bed, not just two twin size beds pushed together. There is very nice mood lighting throughout the room but the lighting over the bathroom mirror is poor. There was plenty of space on the vanity. There is a huge two person shower witha  rain shower head and the back of the shower is decorated with a huge ""moon"" mirror. Bathrobes are supplied and the towels were nice and plush.The bath looked wonderful, a huge oval free-standing bath and the toiletries supplied were L'Occitane en Provence. As well as the usual shampoo, conditioner, shower gels etc there was also a bag of bath salts and a loofah to use in the tub. I only had one complaint about the bath, the plug is poorly designed, it is right in the middle of the bath and sticks up slightly so can be uncomfortable if you don't carefully avoid it!A proper hair dryer is supplied ( instead of the on-the-wall type). A kettle and tea and coffee making products were supplied in the room which was very welcome, as well as a well stocked mini bar. We enjoyed a drink in the bar before dinner ( very colourful - the lighting in the bar goes through different colours every few minutes) and followed that with dinner in the main restaurant. The meal was delicious, the menu was extensive and included some interesting local specialties and the wine list was huge!  Service in the bar and restaurant was friendly and very attentive. Our wine was served with real panache. We returned to the room to find that housekeeping had provided turn-down service, chocolates, fresh towels etcWe slept very well as the town was so quiet, the only sound was the tinkle of cow bells! We had a lovely view from our room down the valley to the centre of town and up to the mountains. The breakfast buffet was very extensive, we were offered the choice of fried eggs or an omellete and there was also scrambled eggs on the buffet as well as bacon and a wide range of fruits, pastries, cold meats and cheeses, fruits juices etc. The head waiter remebered us from the evening before and gave us a kind farewell when we left - excellent attention to detail!On leaving the hotel we were given a cellophane wrapped gift - a delicious small cake. We were delighted with our choice of hotel and would definitely recommend it."
Sep 2013,50,Nice hotel and spa,"A wonderful vacation and skiingLivigno has never failed. Hotel is very clean and inviting. It is best, however, swimming pool and sauna world. After skiing experience here amazing relax.The food is good and the selection was always sufficient.The hotel can come to ski. The first lift is a few meters from the hotel, so do not need any bus. You can put on ski boots right at the hotel.PROS:+ Swimming pool and sauna world+ Availability to lift+ Nice, clean, comfortable and spacious rooms+ location+ Dishes and a selection of dishes during dinnerCONS:- One of the waiters was very unprofessional. He acted as a director of The Globe and guests are unwelcome. Needlessly destroy the name of the hotel. We hope next time he will not work here. He destroyed the useless experience of our holiday. Other staff was friendly.- Ski room was opened without private lockers- nothing more"
Jul 2013,40,"Great biking hotel, shame about the coffee","We always stay here on our bike trips through Italy. It's a gem by livingno standards, clean, modern, spacious. Has a spa. The big let down is the breakfast coffee - simply awful - and in Italy of all places!"
Apr 2013,40,"very beautyful structure, excellent food and restaurant/bar service; cold welcome at recetion","all perfect except welcome, reception staff is not really professional as I demand for a 4s;excellent kitchen and breakfast buffet, very nice and charm service staff, I love fast service at dinnerComfortable rooms, very clean and housekeeping always ready to fullfill every demand"
Apr 2013,50,Fabulous Hotel,"Arrived after a long car journey from England , had booked a Family Room for myself, my husband and 3 children aged 19,15 and 5 which provided plenty of space and storage !    Everything was very clean and top quality .    We stayed on a HB basis and the breakfast was fresh and plentiful , great coffees and any kind of eggs you wished for cooked to order !   The evening meal 4 or 5 courses was excellent , a real variety of foods , buffet starters, veal, boar, seafood etc and wonderful deserts!   The Maitre d went out of his way to accommodate my 5 year olds limited diet, not easy I can assure you !     The walk from Boot Room to Nursery Slope is about 1 minute and suited us fine , the older ones taking lifts up to the top (3000ft) and skiing back down ..  Spa was excellent and we swam and took saunas every afternoon after skiing .    All in all we couldn't fault the hotel or town of Livigno and will be going back , same time , same place next year !   Looking forward to it already ."
Feb 2013,50,"Great hotel, great people, great location.","Great hotel, great people, great location and this was our second visit. We will definitely go back to this hotel if we decide to go back skiing in Livigno. Some feedback for the management of the hotel is the carpet in the room which they should think of replacing in future as it was somewhat used in our room. However, as the room has partially a wooden floor it is a minor issue."
Feb 2013,40,Very good - but beware the ankle biters,"This is a lovely hotel in the remote part of duty free Italy. The snow was great. The proximity to the lifts super.We had a superior room, South facing (what we booked), but only after we were given a North facing, but equally nice room.The disaster was this was school holidays and the noise of dozens  (literally) of children in the surrounding tables made meal times something to be endured. The hotel was full. On the third last night the maitre d' asked why I was having no desert. I replied I could not endure the noise and parents rocking prams in and out between my wife and my chairs any longer. In fact was taking a plate of dessert items from the dining room.I suggested that couples (which made up about one third) should be given one area and family groups the other area. Simple good hotel keeping. Thinking about the guest experience. Some of the staff were great. Some looked down their collective noses so far it was a wonder they could see past their upper lip.To my surprise, we did get moved and the last meals were much more enjoyable. We were not the only couple to feel this was a problem. One honeymoon couple from Ireland were glad to be leaving for Milan.So avoid school holidays (British, European and East European) ANDAsk for a table away from the kids."
Feb 2013,50,Wonderful place!,"Arrived here after a 400 mile drive from the Nurburgring in Germany, the place is lovely, the room was huge, the staff were very polite and helpful - just what we needed!Great view from our balcony, where we watched an impressive lightning storm in the distance the first night.We originally booked the Concordia but got an email a few weeks before our trip saying we'd been moved. Our fears were unfounded, this place is spot on!Can't get in this year, it's fully booked!Trip was July 2011, not 2012."
Feb 2013,40,Lac Salin probably the best Hotel in Livigno,"Stayed in the Sky suite with a tub in the middle of the room that we used one time only. Otherwise this room was not really a suite more of a large room. No sitting area. We missed that.The hotel is almost brand new and nicely done, the rooms are nice with a good size. The restaurant is very nice, good service and the Maitre D was very effective. Would like to give them 5 stars but can only give 4 because of the location. Its in the middle of the town but Livigno is a quite spread out town and to go back and forth to the slopes you need to take the bus, the bus takes from 10-30 minutes x 2 so you loose about 30-40 min / day riding the bus. Thats a major reason why Livigno cannot reach the highest scores. Otherwise its rather cheap in the town taxfree as it is. Food and restaurants are not expensive so if you are on a budget Livigno can be a good choice."
Jan 2013,50,Pefect as last time,"Our second visit to Lac Salin was pefect as the first time: Excellent service, excellent food and service in the restaurant, and very nice hotel rooms. I will recommend everybody to stay at this hotel!See you next time."
Jan 2013,50,Luxury Hotel right on the slopes,"We went here for a family ski holiday. The hotel is in a fantastic location, plenty of restaurants nearby and literally right on the slopes. You can pretty much walk out the hotel door and onto the ski lift.We had a family type room which had a balcony that looked out onto the ski lift. The room itself was laid out well and very comfortable. I couldn't fault the breakfast, great variety of food and a nice relaxed atmosphere. The staff were also very friendly and helpful.The hotel has a swimming pool and leisure centre which was never too busy. Id recommend coming here after skiing everyday to relax before dinner.All in all I cannot fault this hotel. If I was coming back to Livigno I would try stay here again."
Jan 2013,50,Real great hotel,"Very nice hotel and facilities. A great SPA  with various treatments. A bit pricey. Every day all kind of activities:yoga, guided walks and hiking or biking. Good rooms, well maintained and at high standard. The restaurant, the maitre, the food, are excellent one of the best in the 4*Superior class. the dinner is  gourmet and breakfast is great. service everywhere at the hotel was a top notch. Loved every moment.Will be back"
Oct 2012,50,Excellent,"Coming from a poor hotel in Switzerland, this was a refreshing breath of fresh air. The hotel looks just newly refurbished, although it has apparently been completed 6 years ago! The rooms are modern and maintained to very high standards, and the restaurant is worth one of those famous stars. The wine list is comprehensive, and, better of all, reasonably priced (also thanks to the zero-VAT status of Livigno). The breakfast was sumptuous and the service impeccable. I hope to be back soon!"
Sep 2012,50,September stay in a wonderful hotel,We'd a fantastic stay in the middle of September. The hotel and staff is amazing. The rooms are big and very well kept. The spa is also worth visiting as well. The food and the variety of the food was also very good.
Aug 2012,50,"Lovely hotel, helpful staff, good rooms","The owners of this hotel really do go out of their way to do everything they can to help you.  We had stayed here before and this time booked same day and got last room in hotel.  We arrived late at night and staff were sympathetic that we had been travelling and took us straight to our room waiting for full check in next morning.  Spa is lovely though shame only pool is open in the morning.  Most rooms have balconies and are spacious with good bathrooms.  There are lots of lovely touches like fruit bowl and water on arrival. Breakfast is excellent and we had previously eaten in the evening and that was good too.  All round lovely hotel with add ons like bike hire, spa, yoga and various holistic classes if you have money to burn (they are expensive, but better value and far nicer experience than the outrageous new Aqua Grande Spa in Livigno!)."
Aug 2012,50,"Nice hotel with perfect service, nice rooms and an excellent dinner and breakfast","We paid for one night half pension 226 €. The hotel seems to be new, the rooms and the complete locations has a nice ambience. We were with the bicycles there and it is possible to wash the bike in there own garage further they have a bicycle room in the basement. Further the hotel offers a wash service for your bicycles clothes, you can give your clothes in the late afternoon and you will have it back in the evening, really perfect. They will bring your luggage on the room and you will get a welcome drink after your check in. The room has a little balcony with a nice view. The dinner menu is excellent and the service is perfect, this is far more then standard food, the breakfast is also perfect, a bright range of different food and orange juice is fresh pressed. 2 thumbs up, I'm sure I will come back for some days, despite the high price."
Apr 2012,50,Absolutely top hotel,"Lac Salin is on of the best hotels where I have ever been. Almost everything is perfect!I love their spa, it´s really amazing relax after skiing. Water beds in relaxation room are so good.Rooms are big enough, with huge bath and very comfortable bed.The breakfast is very rich, specialy fresh juice from carrots and apples is great, but everything is good quality.In the skiroom is heating for skiboots, which is very usefull.The location is not exactly in center but not far on foot and what is important, hotel is on the slope, so you have to use ski bus only if you want to go to other side to Motolino.This was our second time and we would like to come back again."
Mar 2012,50,Best Hotel in Livigno,"Several Livingno ski instructors confirmed that the Lac Salin is the best ski hotel in the resort. The location is perfect. It is on the slope (60 meters walk to the T-bar, and ski-in right to the entrance) and within 1 min. walk from the free shuttle bus circling Livigno.The rooms are large, well litted, comfortable, modern and well equipped.Both sides of the hotel are facing the slopes and there is a spectacular view from the terrace.The 3 restaurants were above average. When skiing - It is highly recommended to take the HB package as the bus stops working at 8 pm, and the good restaurants are about 15 min. walk from the hotel.The ski rental shop in the hotel carries a large variety of good companies and are open all day round.The service is excellent - Warm and friendly. Our flight was rescheduled, and the hotel manager took it as a personal task to handle all the coordination and bookings.The spa is not crowded and provides a perfect relaxion after a strenous day.We will certainly be back! When planning a trip to Livigno in the winter - Be aware of access and traffic limitations. Try to avoid getting there on a Saturday."
Mar 2012,50,Honeymoon in Livigno.,We were debating which hotel to stay in for our honeymoon. We are so thankful that we decided on the Lac Salin Spa & Mountain resort. Location was perfect. Not far from the center yet neither too close. Atmosphere is great. Accomodation Fantastic. But the staff made all the difference. They were so helpful and friendly. It was truely a fantastic place to stay. Worth every cent.
Feb 2012,50,A warm welcome and top quality service-Excellent place to relax,The hotel team is welcoming and dedicated to make your stay a perfect relaxing time. They serve amazing food in a charming chalet-like restaurant. Located at the bottom of the slopes they provide you with ski rentals. The spa in the hotel is excellent and you can get all types of massage at an affordable price. I highly recommend this hotel and I would come back!
Feb 2012,50,Top quality hotel 100 % recommendation,"The hotel is about 20 min. walk from the centrum of Livigno. We booked for 10 days a Prestige room with HB. The service sould not be better. The room is spacious, clean top equiped. The car should be left because of the low temperatures in the underground 2 floor parking. Each dinner was a celebration of Italian an international superb courses. From the ski room coming you are already  on a ski run and you can start. What we liked very much was the nternational cosmopolitan audience. The guests were coming from I, D, GB, DK, SLO, CZ, CH, F, B, NL, PL, RU, LV.....There were never problems like in the German dominated ressorts with the towel reservations or fights over the buffet.By leaving we got a voucher for the next stay and we will come back that is sure. Last but not least the parking and garage are free.But there are also small enervating problems like the unstable wifi, which logs you out during writing email and all is lost and you can start once again. Livigno has two different skiing areas, the other side can only be reached by your own car or by the free village bus service. The hotel offers no ski bus."
Feb 2012,50,Great hotel,"We are currently staying at the hotel and what a great find. Our room (304) has a vaulted ceiling, a large bathroom with double vanity and lots of space.  Lots of mirrors and closet space makes the room a nice place to hang out even with 4 in the family.Everything is new and I have seldom stayed in a hotel that clean. Somebody is cleaning something all the time. The breakfast is plentyfull and with great coffee. Actually now I think about it, dont stay here, I wanna keep this for myself. ;)Here in week 7 the hotel is filled with about 75% danish people, and the pool is unfortunately too crowded, but how can it be different with everybody wanting to get home in the pool after a day of skiing. The staffs are All so nice. Especially the guys in the ski rental, and the ski in ski out is great. All your equipment are kept in a warm room beside the lobby so no reason to drag boots to the room.Their parking basement is completely enclosed, so dont worry about the car starting after a week in the cold."
Feb 2012,50,Everything about this hotel ouses class,"What an incredible resort. From the Champagne reception to the world class Spa facilities, from the ski-in-ski-out location in the heart of Livigno, to the elegant, spacious and well presented bedrooms. Everything about this hotel ouses class. It is little wonder the Porsche Ski club call this home."
Feb 2012,50,Excellent,"Can't fault it, top class. Great location next to the slopes in great resort."
Oct 2011,50,"Stunning setting, superb food","This hotel is a bit fiddly to find when you've driven from East Anglia and are both very tired. We we were rewarded with an amazing room, huge bed, beautiful linen, enormous plush bathroom, stunning view of the Alps from our personal balcony. We ate in the ""Ski lodge"" style restaurant, and it was truly divine, and quite reasonable. The service was first class, and we were made to feel comfortable and welcome throughout. All of this was made even better for getting a bargain on LateRooms for a quarter of their normal room price. Simply stunning."
Aug 2011,50,Very good bike Hotels,"We came (young couple) for 5 nights in this hotel for the second times, this summer, to ride bikes and enjoy of the wellness center. The staff is always great and friendly, it's better to call them instead to use an intermediate website to book. They provide good informations and tips.The Hotel is a good place to come with his MTB, you have a place to store it and wash it if needed and Livigno is great place to ride (XC or DH MTB). This year there were no bike guide, it may come again next year. For people who doesn't know the area, it's a plus.Rooms and in general the Hotel are beautiful and with a great view on mountains.After a day of biking, we could use the wellness center without extra fees. The only cons that we have is that we found the bed a little bit hard this time, we didn't notice it the first time we came."
Jun 2011,50,Complete rest and relaxation,"My husband and I arrived at Lac Salin after a long road trip from Rotterdam, and were warmly welcomed by Riccardo with a glass of sparkly and given the opportunity to relax whilst our check in was completed.  We were introduced to Fabio (Owner) and Mauro (Manager) who assisted us with our luggage to our room.  This had spectacular views of the Alps from the balcony, was spacious with separate lounge area and a roomy bathroom - with a great power shower.  From the cleaning staff to the waiting staff, nothing was any trouble - eggs cooked to order each morning and additional towels each evening if required.  Being a Spa hotel, we took advantage of the chance to unwind using the Spa most evenings - we also enjoyed a few treatments - though more expensive than other places we've been.  A wide variety of choices for breakfast and dinner, the food was lovely and a light option available if you wished - local specialities on offer each evening also.  Highly recommend trying Sforzato, lovely red wine from the Valtellina  region.  If you make it to Livigno, make sure and stay over at Lac Salin, you won't be disappointed.  Thanks to you all for making it a holiday to remember."
May 2011,50,Total relaxation,"I recommend the SPA, it's a must have if you stay in Lac Salin. You'll find the Lac Salin to be a cozy place even if the hotel is a big one by Livigno standards. Has an open parking place and an indoor parking place, for free. It's not in the center, if there is any, but in winter you can take your boots and sky right from the hotel as there is a sky-lift near by.  Livigno is also a very nice place to sky and to do shopping."
Mar 2011,50,Heaven on earth,"First week of march 2011 we did spend a fantastic week in Hotel Lac Salin, we had a reservation in the also very nice Hotel Concordia but something went wrong with reservation/e-mail, small misunderstanding and so we got a room in Hotel Lac Salin.The chakra suite,, heaven"" that we had for this week was very nice, large room with nice sunny balcony that looks over the skipiste. The room is something you see in a  magazine : Italian Design in optima forma; there is a modern bathtub in the middle of the  room with a window above it  that opens with a remote control. A big golden leather chair on a white fur carpet.  The bed is made of white leather with crocoprint, realy very nice and different. The large bathroom has everything you need, even mouthwash and shaving cream, and the largesize shower has also a wooden floor, we travel a lot but this we had never seen before. The towels are changed several times a day, by the way those towels smell so nice and fresh, also heavenly.There are fluffy nice bathrobes and slippers to go to the spa.The spa is spacious, with sauna, herbalbath, turkish bath, relaxing beds, very nice showers, large pool, whirlpool, training room, sunbanks, etc. etc. and you can have a lot of treatments in the spa, like massages and various  treatments for heath and skin. There is a little ,,bar"" for free softdrinks and warming tea's.The meals are what you expect from a 4 1/2 star hotel, good quality Italian cuisine, specialy the antipasto buffet is everyday a suprise, it was difficult not to eat to much of it, because there is pasta ( choise of 4) and a maincourse ( also choise of 4) coming . The dessert buffet is also fantastic with a large variety of Italian dessert and pies. The winelist has a lot of choise of very good wines. Breakfast 5 stars, with fresh carrotjuice, eggs made at your choise and a lot of cheese and ham etc. The hotel was fully booked but all the items at the buffets at breakfast or diner were never empty and refilled constantly - perfection, the people that work in the restaurant are very professionel, nice and friendly, they see everything, so there is never an empty plate in the buffet. For skiing the hotel has maybe the best position in Livigno, you step down from the terras and you walk 30 seconds to the first skilift that will take you to the best skiarea ever, wide pistes that are so huge that you are almost  alone on the mountain, we never waited longer than a few minutes for any lift. On the mountain you can eat for a few euro's nice Italian dishes (not too much think of the buffet tonight!!!)  After a superday you can ski all the way back to the hotel, step up the terras for a warm bombardillo.Your car is in the garage that has a carwash and air for your tyres, how nice.Is there nothing negative about this place? yes : AFTER YOUR HOLLIDAY YOU HAVE TO LEAVE ."
Jan 2011,50,Heaven in the snow,"A lovely modern hotel with fantastic features and facilities, right on the foot of one of the many slopes in Livignp and beginner runs. The rooms are spacious, comfortable and clean. The hotel also has in-house ski-hire facilities which make renting equipment easy. The restaurant has a great selection in their breakfast buffet and a delicious 4 course dinner menu. Their indoor pool, herbal bath, sauna & steam room create a great relaxing facility after an active day on the slopes. Definately a hotel to enjoy your holiday at!"
Jan 2011,50,Wonderful Winter Holiday,"We spent eight glorious nights as a family in this beautifully located hotel.The rooms are exceptionally well appointed and comfortable, all with unbeleivable views of the area. Its proximity to the ski slopes is excellent, particularly for beginners, with the added advantage of its own ski rental facility.The staff are very efficient, cordial and go out of their way to make your stay memorable.An added delight was the very good and varied cuisine."
Jan 2011,50,Superb!,"Prime location on the slopes, great facilities and great views. Stayed on a HB basis, well worth it as the food is excellent. Staff all very friendly. The spa was an added bonus after a day on the slopes. Would definately recommend this to anyone visiting Livigno."
Nov 2010,40,"Nice experience, but ...","We visited Livingno for a 5 days at the end of the 2010 winter season.  The hotel is located bit away from the shopping centre of the village (about 20 minutes to walk) with an easy and excellent approach to the Carosello lifts. It provides guests with very high standard of accommodation, gastronomy and spa/relax facilities.  We found the room to be enough spacious for a 2 adults + 3 year old child.  Even we enjoyed our stay I have two negative remarks.I had asked reception 2 days before the arrival about the conditions for kids skiing (kids lift and ski rental) and was assured that ski rental is available in the hotel and a ski lift runs just next to it. Unfortunately after the arrival we found that ski rental has already packed and removed all kids’ equipment and the lift was 50% disassembled. I understand that the season was almost off, but to know it before we could rent something at home.The hotel offers the fine art traditional food; I would even say that this is of the highlights. As we had some friends to meet for one dinner in the village we didn’t book our stay incl. half board.  The price to book dinner individually was set to 40 EUR / person for 4 course menu or some item price for starter, main course etc. which we accepted as the more reasonable solution to eat with 3 years old boy. Although we had all the 3 days the same selection of one starter, one salad buffet and one or two main courses we were charged every day differently.  When I complained directly when signing the bill at the last day (I didn’t care for 5 EUR difference at the day before), the chief of the crew (he forgot to speak German or English – even 10 minutes before had a nice discussion with the guest seating next to us) not much politely replied that all the previous bill were wrong, because to pick a piece of cheese after the diner to enjoy nice but bit overpriced wine means to pay another 10 EUR / person, as it is no more a salad buffet but the desert, and the price of starter selection is actually not 10 EUR but 15 EUR etc. The front desk staff agreed that this is not standard but as you choose from the daily menu items there is no fixed price on the item. So effectively we paid 75EUR for one starter, one salad buffet, one main course and 2 pieces of local cheese. Almost the same price as two full 4 course dinners. Even I said the food is really good we considered their menu presentation as very unclear almost cheating. To book menu for the price of 40 EUR is acceptable all other ways seem to be unreasonable comparing to quality of food and price of candle dinner in the neighbour restaurants."
Apr 2010,50,A great standard of accommodation,"We had a wonderful stay at the Lac Salin from robes and slippers in the rooms clean towelstwice a day wonderful views. The bar was on the expensive side at €5 for a glass of winebut the quality of the wine was good, the spa was spotless with free drinks (Soft), we were on a B&B basis as we have spent many summers and winters in Livigno and know there are many fab restaurants to eat in, but the hotel menu looked very pleasant.I would highly recommend this hotel slightly more expensive then most but you  always get what you pay for."
Feb 2010,40,Nice holiday,"We have stayed with my husbend in Jan 2010. At first sight we were disappointed by reception during check in. Very slow and there was no bell man or anybody to help with our luggage and we had a lot of it. But next day everything was allright. Nice view, very stylish and lovely decorated rooms. Clean SPA & gym. We liked it so much that will come back in March. And Steak House nearby is perfect for dining!"
Jan 2010,50,Great Hotel & Nice skiing,"Hello, we just came from Livigno (Jan 2010). Hotel and its facilities are great. We had BB service and found nearby great STEAK House for dinner, dont miss it. Hotel and its staff are great.Snow slopes are in excellent condition, but some of the ski lifts are very old and deserve to be replaced.Bus transport within the village is OK, but ends at 8pm.There are plenty of BRAND name shops, but be carefull, prices of clothes, shoess except liquers and cigaretes, even on sale are 50% higher than in shoping centres in Italy or even 70% in Outlet mools. Fuell is 0,7 E/lit."
Sep 2009,40,"Beautiful scenery, nice hotel","On our way to the Stelvio Pass, we stayed in Livigno at the Lac Salin spa resort. Beautiful setting, trendy hotel, with 3 restaurants- although at the time only one was operating- good food and wine. The wine was a bit pricey though and we doidn;t find it anything special. The village itself is like any other Alpine ski resort, with the advantage of tax free stores. It is very nice and very enjoyable to walk.We certainly enjoyed our short stay, would have liked to relax one more day or so.."
Aug 2009,50,stunning contemporary hotel in beautiful location,Attention to the style detail of this hotel is carefully thought out which gives off a warm casual and friendly atmosphere. The rooms are very light and airy with great views up and down the valley. We stayed in one room with our town children and there was plenty of space.The pool and spa facilities are very good and well maintained.the restaurants provided good food with very attentive service.In a bustling town this hotel is an oasis - i would recommend it.
Sep 2008,50,Great hotel in Livigno,"Hi This is a fantastic hotel, highly recommended, very friendly and very clean. Great facilities and great views. This is also a very good hotel for bikers as the parking is first class. There are plenty of places to eat in Livigno and bars are are also friendly."
Mar 2008,30,Great location - Nice hotel - Service could be better !,"Stayed for a week in March 2008, long trek from Milan but just about worth it. Arrived around 3pm, Welcome from Reception about as cold as the temperature outside! No one slightly interested in our luggage, name given, passports taken, key card handed over, the end.... Nice room although above entrance and bar area so was quite noisy.The room was spacious, had comfortable beds, a newly refurbished bathroom and was very pleasant and modern. Tap water really refreshing to drink. At breakfast, staff completely dissinterested, we were approached once during the week, for tea or coffee, otherwise you had to try to catch someones attention to get anything. Buffet food was standard fare.Reception staff greeted us maybe once or twice during the 30 or 40 times we passed by during the week. Service is not their strong point and should be addressed. Bar staff & external waiters were better. Ski hire is in the basement and this was really convenient. The assistant (Amani) was really helpful and quite a character. The evening meal we had seemed to take forever, the staff were rushed off their feet and the place seemed chaotic. The food was very average, the sea bass was the smallest I ever saw and had dozens of bones, not great. We didn't eat dinner again and tried several of the many decent restauraunts nearby.  The Spa is excellent, nice pool, steam room, sauna, herbal room, jacuzzi., very good massage, friendly and efficient staff. Great resort overall and many people said this was the best hotel in the area, perhaps if it is always full, the management could get complacent. Overall I probably would stay here again but definately get a room on the top floor, facing the ski slopes even better."
Mar 2008,40,Hotel Lac Salin,"a group of 6 of us returned from our ski holiday in Livigno about a week ago. We stayed at Hotel Lac Salin and Spa Mountain Resort. The hotel was beautiful. very clean, rooms spacious and equipped with the essentials - EXCEPT complimentary tea/coffee????? THis was absolutely bizarre to us - having come from London and Zurich hotels on route to our ski destination. When we enquired about the absence of a tea/coffee facilty in the room, the receptionist looked astonished that we could even ask for the facility. OTher than that the hotel's location is great - ski in/ski out - you can get all your ski gear at the hotel - they have a ski rental facility with very helpful gentlemen as well as a help desk to book ski lessons etc, etc. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The waiters in the restaurant are fantastic and really go the extra mile. The restaurant food is great - although they could improve slightly on their variety - seemed to be the same type of salad/veg on offer every day. There was no variation with the types of fruit on offer at breakfast - but this could all be seasonal (not sure). All in all we had a fantastic time, the vibe in Livigno is great - loads of pubs etc. We will definitely stay there again when we go back to Italy for skiing."
Aug 2007,50,"A beautiful hotel and Spa, in a beautiful location","I stayed in the Lac Salin hotel for the 1st time this summer, when I visited livigno for a walking and mountain biking week, with a couple of friends.  I couldn't of asked for anything better it's a beautiful hotel, the rooms are modern, spacious and comfortable and we had a fantastic view over the valley from the balcony.  On an afternoon they have a lovely Spa centre and Pool which you can relax by and I'd definitly suggest booking for one of the massages, very relaxing.  The staff were all really friendly and helpful, they were able to suggest places to visit and walks to do, which was great as theres so many to choose from.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and I hope to be returning for my Skiing holiday this winter."
